# Firefox Screenshot to Google Lens

## Usage

This extension lets you send to Google Lens a screenshot of a web page either in viewport, in selection area or in full size!

1. Access the add-on via the toolbar or [by assigning hotkeys](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox). This will reveal the 3 options, "Selection", "Visible Area", and "Full Page", which determines the area to be screenshotted.
2. Your selection will be screenshotted and will be sent to Google Lens.
3. A new tab will open to lens.google.com with the screenshot loaded in.
